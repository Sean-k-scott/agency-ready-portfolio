        <h2><strong>About</strong></h2>
        <h3>A front end developer specialising in <strong>bespoke wordpress themes</strong> aesthetically refined and highly tailored to <strong>suit you and your business</strong></h3>
        <p>From Lancashire in the North-West of England, having a love of computers and technology from a young age, I originally started out training to be a Network Engineer.</p>
        <p>On top of my Networking experience, I tapped into my creative side and learnt to program and operate lighting and sound for Theatre Productions.</p>
        <p>This led to me deciding to return to University as a mature student, retraining myself in website development.</p>
        <p>I've spent the past 9 months working with <a href="https://www.icansee.co.uk" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">icansee digital agency</a> creating bespoke wordpress themes for clients, enjoying every moment.</p>
        <p>I'm continuing to grow and improve my abilities in my professional life, improving my abilty to write clean and efficient code and provide clients with quick loading, responsive and attractive sites.</p>

        <div class="collapsed row1">
          <h3>How long have you been a developer?</h3>
          <span class="open-close"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="content1">
          <p>I have only been a devloper for a short time, around 9 months as of writing this (Nov 2019). I have over 10 years of working experience in IT picking up a variety of cross-applicable skills however.</p>

          <h3>Why did you decide to become a developer?</h3>
          <span class="open-close"></span>
        </div>
          <div class="content2">
          <p>After working in IT Networking, and further along working in Theatre Lighting and Sound Production, I made the decision to retrain to become a developer, because I wanted to combine my IT knowledge and interest with my Theatre creativity on a daily basis.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="collapsed row3">
            <h3>Why full-time over part-time university?</h3>
          <span class="open-close"></span>
        </div>
          <div class="content3">
            <p>A variety of factors, I didn't have any long term monetary commitments (renting instead of mortgage, car lease etc), and I had a readily available part time job in my freelance theatre work to supplement my income. I also decided that focusing my energies into a shorter amount of time would allow me to start my new career quicker.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="collapsed row4">
            <h3>Do you recommend university as a mature student?</h3>
          <span class="open-close"></span>
        </div>
        <div class="content4">
          <p>Absolutely! It takes some adjusting to, especially if you haven't been in education for a while, but it allows you to have focus, guidance and clear goals when learning a new skill or planning a career change which is invaluable. You are also more certain about what you want out of the experience.</p>
