        <h2>The Industry &amp; Me</h2>
        <h3>October 2019</h3>
        <h4>by Sean Scott</h4>
        <p>According to the Manchester Digital Skills Audit, over 80% of businesses surveyed have recruited for new positions in the past year, with developers being the most in-demand role, and hardest role, to fill. Looking towards the future, over the next 3 years developer also topped the list of skillsets that will grow in importance (Manchester Digital, 2019).</p>
        <p>This falls in line with my career aspirations, upon completion of my degree I would like to enter the workplace as a full-time front end developer, and it is clear that I have chosen a popular and in-demand role and that there will be plenty of opportunities to find work. </p>
        <p>The study also revealed that the most in-demand programming languages are PHP, Javascript, Java, C# and HTML (Manchester Digital, 2019), I am already regularly using three of these languages in sites that I have developed and that I am currently developing, and provides a source of growth with the other two languages.</p>
        <p>Finally, the industry consensus seems to be that graduates do not develop with the career skills required for the workplace. I hope to improve on this in my time spent in the development workplace since March of this year.</p>
        <p>The Tech Nation Report (Tech Nation, 2019), states that ‘the UK is a critical hub in the global tech ecosystem, and a strong economic performer” (Tech Nation:6, 2019). The industry is performing above expectations, and Manchester is a hub of meet-ups and information available to share and collaborate between industry members. This makes being in proximity of Manchester a valuable asset to my future career in tech.</p>
        <p>As well as local there is the online collaboration that the tech industry provides, with StackOverflow, GitHub, Smashing Magazine and CSS-Tricks, readily available advice and information is at the industries fingertips. These resources are instrumental in closing the gap between graduate skills and required industry skills that was mentioned in the Manchester Digital Audit.</p>
        <p>Articles such as ‘Exploring New Ways to Manage Content in Wordpress’ (Losoviz, 2019) in Smashing Magazine that explore newer ways to use industry staple tools such as Wordpress, or ‘Dark mode with CSS’ (Rendle, 2019) help to improve a graduates skillset without writing a single line of code, partaking in research of this kind is paramount to personal skillset growth and increasing employability.</p>
        <p>Experts do remind us, however, to ensure that whilst creativity and new technologies are the future of the industry, we need to make certain that the sites we create continue to be as accessible, responsive and fast.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Wagner discusses JavaScript on A List Apart, discussing using JavaScript responsibly when the time it takes to download and process JavaScript can have a significant impact on the browsing experience. (Wagner, 2019).</p>
        <p>Usability.gov have a useful guide and best practices to making accessible sites(usability.gov, 2019), including links to w3’s accessibility section and WCAG Guidelines that we should ensure each site we create follows, regardless of the design or complexity. (w3.org, 2019).</p>
        <p>Personally, these industry reports show me which areas I need to focus on to be the most successful in the tech industry. I think that the industries growth and the UK’s focus on the tech sector will continue to provide opportunities for new people entering the industry. Being a mature student, I hope that my communication skills and workplace experience will give me a boost in finding employment post graduation.</p>
